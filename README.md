# Zero-modified-model
The R code is for the article "A New Algorithm for Zero-Modified Models Applied to Citation Counts". This article proposes a new algorithm to fit zero-modified versions of discretised log-normal, hooked power-law and Weibull models to citation count data from 23 different
Scopus categories from 2012. The new algorithm allows the standard errors of all parameter
estimates to be calculated, and hence also confidence intervals and p-values. This algorithm
can also estimate both negative and positive zero-modification parameters corresponding to zero-deflation and zero-inflation in the datasets.
